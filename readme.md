An analysis of water main break data from the Baltimore City Department of Public Works, the [Maryland Reported Sewer Overflow Database](https://mde.maryland.gov/programs/water/compliance/pages/reportedseweroverflow.aspx) from the Maryland Department of the Environment and the [311 Customer Service requests](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/City-Services/311-Customer-Service-Requests/9agw-sxsr) dataset from Open Baltimore for a Dec. 18, 2018 Baltimore Sun story titled ["By the numbers: The toll winter takes on Baltimore's infrastructure"](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-infrastructure-by-the-numbers-20181211-story.html).
